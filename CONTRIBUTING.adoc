Contributing is as easy as:

- Check if the site you want to contribute already advertises an https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/OpenSearch[OpenSearch descriptor].
- Create an OpenSearch descriptor by modifying the existing one from this repo or online using https://ready.to/search/en[OpenSearch XML generator].
- Place the descriptor in `src/opensearch/${domain}/opensearch.xml`, where `${domain}` is the target site.
If there are multiple searches possible for that domain use nested directories.
The descriptor *must* be named `opensearch.xml` anyway.
- Update the `README.adoc`, add a link to the autogenerated page that advertises the descriptor.
Try to maintain the alphabetical order by the `ShortName` field.
- Commit your change and submit a PR.
Preferably on https://gitlab.com/madhead/awesome-opensearch[GitLab], but https://github.com/madhead/awesome-opensearch[GitHub] is ok too.
- Thanks!

If you don't want to bother with OpenSearch descriptors, Git, Pull Request and all that stuff but still want to have a search plugin â€” don't hesitate to submit an issue with you wish.
